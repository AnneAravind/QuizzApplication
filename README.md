# QuizzApplication
I developed a Quiz Application using Spring Boot with basic CRUD operations. It allows creating, updating, viewing, and deleting quiz questions. Integrated with a database via Spring Data JPA, the project highlights my skills in RESTful API development, backend design, and data management.
